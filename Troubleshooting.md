## 4. Troubleshooting

### Common Issues and Fixes
- **Video Won’t Open**:
  - **Cause**: The video might be copy-protected (e.g., some DVDs or files downloaded from streaming services).
  - **Fix**: Try a different video file or export edited videos (e.g., from iMovie) to a supported format before using HandBrake.
- **Conversion is Slow**:
  - **Cause**: Long or high-quality videos take more time to convert, especially on slower computers.
  - **Fix**: Use a “Fast” preset (e.g., Fast 1080p30) or ensure your computer has a good graphics card (GPU) for faster processing.
- **No Sound**:
  - **Cause**: An audio track may not be selected.
  - **Fix**: Go to the Audio tab and ensure at least one audio track is selected (usually automatic with presets).
- **File Too Big or Too Small**:
  - **Cause**: The quality setting (RF number) affects file size.
  - **Fix**: Adjust the RF slider in the Video tab—lower RF (e.g., 18–20) for better quality and larger files, higher RF (e.g., 24–26) for smaller files with lower quality.
- **HandBrake Won’t Open**:
  - **Cause**: Installation issues or security restrictions.
  - **Fix**: 
    - **Windows**: Reinstall HandBrake and ensure Microsoft .NET 8.0 is installed.
    - **macOS**: If blocked, right-click the HandBrake icon in Applications and select “Open.”
    - **Linux**: Reinstall via your app store or Flatpak instructions at https://flathub.org/apps/fr.handbrake.ghb.
