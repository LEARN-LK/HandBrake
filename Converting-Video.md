## 2. Converting a Video

### Basic Conversion Steps
1. **Open HandBrake**: Double-click the HandBrake icon (it looks like a cocktail glass and pineapple).
2. **Choose Your Video**:
   - Click “Open Source” in the top-left corner or drag your video file into the HandBrake window.
   - For DVDs, insert the disc and select the main title (usually the longest one) from the dropdown menu.
3. **Pick a Preset**:
   - Choose a preset from the right panel:
     - **General > Fast 1080p30**: Works well for most devices (phones, PCs, TVs).
     - **Devices**: Select your specific device (e.g., iPhone, Roku, Apple TV).
   - **Tip**: Start with “Fast 1080p30” for simplicity.
4. **Set Output Location**:
   - In the “Save As” box, choose a folder to save your converted video (e.g., Desktop).
   - Edit the file name if needed (e.g., “MyVideo_converted.mp4”).
5. **Preview (Optional)**:
   - Click the “Preview” button in the toolbar, select a short clip duration, and click “Live Preview” to check the video quality.
6. **Start Converting**:
   - Click the green “Start” button (play icon) in the toolbar.
   - Wait for the conversion to finish (time depends on video length and computer speed).
   - Check the output folder for your new video file.

### Converting Multiple Videos (Queue)
- **Steps**:
  1. Open a video, set the preset and destination, then click “Add to Queue.”
  2. Repeat the process for each additional video.
  3. Click “Show Queue” in the toolbar and press “Start Queue” to convert all videos in the queue.
- **Tip**: Use the queue for processing multiple files at once, such as overnight conversions.
