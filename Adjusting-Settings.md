## 3. Adjusting Basic Settings

### Video Quality (Video Tab)
- **Quality Slider**:
  - Adjust the “RF” (Rate Factor) number in the Video tab to balance quality and file size:
    - **Lower RF (18–20)**: Higher quality, larger file size.
    - **Higher RF (24–26)**: Lower quality, smaller file size.
    - For 1080p videos, try RF 20–22 for a good balance.
- **Tip**: Stick with the preset’s default quality setting for simplicity when starting out.

### Audio (Audio Tab)
- **Settings**:
  - Ensure at least one audio track is selected (HandBrake usually selects one automatically).
  - Choose the “AAC” codec and “Stereo” mixdown for standard audio output.
- **Tip**: The default audio settings work well for most videos, so you likely won’t need to change them.

### Subtitles (Subtitles Tab)
- **Settings**:
  - If your video has subtitles (e.g., for foreign dialogue), select them in the Subtitles tab.
  - Check “Burn In” if you want subtitles permanently embedded in the video (useful for devices like TVs that don’t support separate subtitle files).
- **Tip**: Skip this tab if your video doesn’t need subtitles.
